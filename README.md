# Introduction 
The concept of digital stores gained prominence during the pandemic, as large retailers sought to minimize operational costs and explore more affordable store locations. By leveraging technology and data analytics, they addressed supply chain bottlenecks and expanded their networks through collaboration with local kirana shops to meet customer demand. Home delivery options and digital payment methods, such as UPI platforms like PhonePe, Google Pay, PayTM, and Bharat Pe, saw significant growth and are expected to continue expanding. The integration of online and offline retailing has facilitated hyperlocal and speedy delivery, reducing the need for extensive warehousing. The convenience and accessibility of online grocery shopping have reshaped consumer behavior, especially in urban areas. This complex landscape of logistical operations and customer preferences presents a rich field for algorithmic problem-solving, offering opportunities to optimize operational efficiencies, enhance user experiences, and significantly contribute to the evolution of modern commerce.
